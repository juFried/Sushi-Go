## Sushi Go

To practice my skills with managing memory, and demonstrate my ability to program in C, I created Sushi Go. This idea was inspired by the CS 11 final project at Tufts University, which requires students to build their own Sushi Go game (based off the common card game).
With this purpose in mind, I include additional layers of complexity throughout the program such as hash tables, linked lists, binary trees, merge sort, recursion and dynamicly allocated two-demensional arrays that are not strictly necessary.

Since Sushi Go does not have any file requirements, you can simply download the code from GitHub or paste it into a C file to run it.

Sushi Go is intended to simulate the card game "Sushi Go". Although this program does not include user input for their "turn", users are welcome to expand on this code to include more user involvement.

All are welcome to use my version of Sushi Go or build off of it free of charge for personal or commercial use.
